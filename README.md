# Iowa_Housing_Prediction
 Hello there! This was the first Weekly Assignment (Weekly Assignment 1) from IndonesiaAI Computer Vision (CV) Bootcamp Batch 2.
 
 This assignment was from Ames Iowa Housing Dataset.

# Getting started
We extracted the dataset from the file [Dataset-20230718T042907Z-001.zip](https://github.com/LSardiani/Iowa_Housing_Prediction/files/12076104/Dataset-20230718T042907Z-001.zip)

After unzipped the file, you will find files:

train.csv - the training set

test.csv - the test set

data_description.txt - full description of each column, originally prepared by Dean De Cock but lightly edited to match the column names used here

sample_submission.csv - a benchmark submission from a linear regression on year and month of sale, lot square footage, and number of bedrooms

# Background
“Participants in the real estate industry can use technology to make faster and better decisions… [but] the real estate sector is one of the few remaining sectors of our economy that has created immense wealth with little or no technology know-how and interest.” Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania

Some models have been explored in previous research: Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regression, Gradient Boosting Machine, and Random Forest.

# Model
We used Linear Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest Algorithms. The Model Evaluation showed:


# Linear Regression
